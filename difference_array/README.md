# Difference Array

There are basically 2 types of difference array applications.
- Continuous
- Discrete

An example for continuous difference array is [2237](2237_count_positions_on_street_with_required_brightness/2237_count_positions_on_street_with_required_brightness.cpp).

For cases where the difference array boundaries are not sure, or the range is too large for an array to fit in, we can use a `map` as a discrete differece array.([1943](1943_describing_the_painting/1943_describing_the_painting.cpp), [2015](2015_average_height_of_buildings_in_each_segment/2015_average_height_of_buildings_in_each_segment.cpp)).
